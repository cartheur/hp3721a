The Model 3722A Noise Generator uses digital techniques to synthesize binary and Gaussian noise patterns. These _pseudorandom_ patterns, which are of known content and duration, are repeated over and over without interruption. Since one pattern is identical with th4 net, each pattern has the same effect on the system under test: For this reason, pseudorandom noise signals cause no statistical variance in test results. The Model 3722A also generates truly random binary and Gaussian noise.
