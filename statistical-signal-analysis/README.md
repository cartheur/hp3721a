## Statistical signal analysis

Analytical methods currently used in all branches of engineering are based almost exclusively on well-defined forms of test signal such as the sine wave and square wave. Testing with these simple deterministic signals has been accepted practice for many years; results are seldom difficult to obtain, and well-established methods exist for their analysis.

Suppose we wished to measure the dynamic characteristics of a control system: One method would be to measure gain and phase shift at a number of frequencies. Alternatively we might choose to observe the system's transient response to a step or impulse test signal: Again, the results can be interpreted to give a complete description of system behavior. Stating fact: Practical tests using sine waves, steps, and impulses are a firmly established part of the field of emperical engineering.
